spork: When you need more than a spoon
=================================================


The emerging field of topological signal processing brings methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to create new tools for signal processing by incorporating aspects of shape.
This python package, spork, is a companion package to teaspoon.
All code is open source with up to date documentation, making the code easy to use, in particular for signal processing experts with limited experience in topological methods.
